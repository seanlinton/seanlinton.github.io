                    These graphs show what people think about the amount of responsibility that different groups:
                    individuals, communities, corporations, and governments have when it comes to causing and reducing
                    climate change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can see that across the board, people think that all of these groups are not doing enough for climate change.
					It is evident that the general opinion is that governments and corporations are not doing enough, even more so than individuals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is important to note as everyone needs to be doing what they can to help climate change. 
					However, the amount of work put in needs to reflect the relative damage caused.
                </p>
				<p>
                    This is not saying that individuals should simply do nothing, rather they should do what is in their power. 
					And if their responsibility is not within their power, action needs to be taken in order to get the necessary resources and capabilities to do so.

                    The average U.S. household consumes around 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity each month, or
                    12 megawatt-hours (MWh) per year.

                    average U.S. households, which is the highest among the listed companies. Alphabet (Google) and
                    Microsoft are also significantly high, with consumptions equivalent to around 1.52 million and 1.51

                    According to the EPA, the average four-person household produces 83,000 pounds of greenhouse gas
                    emissions per year, or 20,750 pounds per person. This is equivalent to 7.5 tons of CO2-equivalents

                    higher than any other company listed. This could reflect the impact of Samsung's extensive

                    The chart indicates that the most significant source of pressure to protect the climate comes from
                    'Self-Driven' motives, suggesting that personal values and beliefs are the primary motivators for
                    individuals. This could imply a strong individual recognition of climate issues and personal
                    responsibility towards environmental stewardship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    'Communities' and 'Corporations' are also notable sources of pressure, indicating a societal push
                    towards climate action. This might reflect the growing community-driven initiatives and the
                    increasing role of corporate social responsibility in driving sustainable practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    'Government' seems to be a less significant source of pressure compared to the other categories,
                    which could suggest that individuals may not feel as compelled by government actions or policies, or
                    it could reflect a perception that government initiatives are insufficient or not as directly
                    influential on individual actions.

                <p>

                <p>
                    Intel is close behind with 93% renewable energy usage, suggesting significant steps toward
                    sustainability, though not quite at the full 100% mark.

                <p>

                    NVIDIA and QUALCOMM show moderate levels of renewable energy usage at 44% and 34%, respectively.
                    While these figures show a commitment to renewable energy, they also highlight the potential for
                    improvement and further transition.

                <p>
                    We can see that renewable energy usage in households is quite low.

            <p>
                <span>Responsibilization</span> is the transfer of accountability and responsibility of various issues
                from a higher authority (e.g. corporations, governments) to a lower authority (e.g. individuals) whom
                now needs to solve those issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through displaying data obtained in our own research, as well as data obtained from other sources, we
                explore the line of differences in how groups of different levels of power contribute to and resolve
                climate change.
